# Pre-challenge

Inside each folder you will find a problem and tests for your solutions. You
should try to solve all of them, but if you can't do it in time, send it to us
anyway. Documentation and clarification of the pieces of code that are hard to
understand will be taken into account. The solutions should be written in the
corresponding files, and you should send this entire folder without
modification in its structure.

Good luck!
